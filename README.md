## Why a switchboard team?

The Rust community is a large place, with lots going on. It is the
switchboard team’s task to keep a finger on its pulse and generally know what’s going on, and more
importantly who is doing it. We are the single point of contact for people intending to find a
portion of the community, or folks who wish to find like-minded collaborators. We also hold town
halls with companies using Rust and try to provide any help we can as well as bringing back valuable
feedback for the other teams to act on.


## Possible actions

 - Provide a single place for folks to ask questions about the community (can be community-team@ as it currently is)
 - Hold town halls for production users (and other key groups)
 - Engage with companies considering Rust
 - Provide support to conference speakers for both Rust and non-Rust events

## Measurable objectives

 - Friends page size
 - Production town halls run
 - (More generally) companies talked with
