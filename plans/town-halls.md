# Town Halls

We often get approached individually to talk about Rust at companies,
and these chats are often quite helpful in both ways -- they get a clearer idea of how well
Rust fits for them, and we get valuable feedback. (As a side note we perhaps should advertise more that
this is a thing we do)

In the past we've also run town halls, which share similar goals
but are more organized. (https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/production-user-research-summary/2530)

The idea is to take a bunch of companies and/or individual stakeholders working in similar areas of Rust,
and start a video call with them, including relevant Rust-side stakeholders. For example, we could
hold one such chat for folks using Tokio with the folks working on Tokio. Or hold one for
the folks doing embedded development in Rust with those attempting to improve Rust's story in that space.


## Proposal

We attempt to facilitate one of these every 2-3 months, based on what the Rust priorities are.
I imagine Tokio and Embedded to be good candidates for focused town halls, as well as one for FFI users.
But it really depends on what the team wants.

We can also hold generic ones that focus on the onboarding experience and ergonomics.

Generally, a town hall will be a video chat with around 3 companies, with relevant stakeholders from the Rust team,
and last about an hour. Minutes will be taken and posted online (this will be made clear earlier).
We will also attempt to summarize the discussion, and get feedback to appropriate team members if not present.

For the generic ones I suspect putting out a call for participation would be nice, something
like "hey, if you're a company using Rust and want to join in, please let us know!". For the specific
ones, we can contact the developers directly.

We do need to nail down what topics we should be focusing on when organizing these.
